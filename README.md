# Dank Memer Bot Bot
##### A script that farms coins for you in the Dank Memer Discord bot 

### Disclaimer(s)
 - Using a user account as a bot is technically against Discord's ToS.  
 I very much doubt they'll ban your account, but if they do, it's not my responsability.
 - The same thing applies to the Dank Memer bot. If they ban you for 'playing too much' and you lose your Meme Coins, this is not my problem.

### Usage
 1. Make a copy of `config.example.json` into `config.json`
 2. Edit `config.json` and put in your account's Discord token. [Here are the instructions](https://github.com/Tyrrrz/DiscordChatExporter/wiki/Obtaining-Token-and-Channel-IDs#how-to-get-a-user-token) on how to get it
 3. *(Optional)* Edit any other config params you wish to change
 4. Run the script: `$ npm start`
 5. Go to the Discord channel where you want your bot to work and send `$start` (or `$s`)
 6. ???
 7. Profit (in MemeCoins, pun definitely intended)
